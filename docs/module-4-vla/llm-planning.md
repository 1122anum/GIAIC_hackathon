# LLM-Driven Cognitive Planning

Large Language Models (LLMs) enable sophisticated cognitive planning by interpreting natural language commands and generating executable action sequences for robots.

## Natural Language Understanding

- Command interpretation and parsing
- Context-aware command understanding
- Multi-step command decomposition
- Ambiguity resolution
- Intent recognition for robotic tasks

## Cognitive Planning Process

- Mapping high-level commands to low-level actions
- Path planning based on natural language
- Object recognition and manipulation planning
- Task sequencing and dependency management
- Error recovery and fallback planning

## Integration with Robotics

- ROS 2 service integration
- Action server coordination
- Robot state awareness
- Environment state tracking
- Safety constraint enforcement

## Implementation Strategies

- Prompt engineering for robotics tasks
- Fine-tuning for domain-specific commands
- Multi-modal input processing
- Planning validation and verification
- Performance optimization for real-time execution
