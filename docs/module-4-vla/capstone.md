- Real-time perception and action execution
- Human-robot interaction capabilities
- Safety and error handling systems
- Multi-modal integration

## Voice Control Implementation

- End-to-end voice command processing
- Natural language understanding pipeline
- Context-aware command execution
- Multi-turn dialogue management
- Voice feedback and confirmation

## Navigation and Manipulation
