# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This course provides hands-on experience with humanoid robots (Unitree Go2/G1), sensor systems (RealSense, IMU), and AI platforms (Jetson Orin) through a structured curriculum with 5 modules and a capstone project.

## Course Overview

This course integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies:

- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System for robotics software development
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: AI platform for robotics perception and navigation
- **Gazebo Simulation**: Physics-based simulation environment
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Systems that connect perception, language, and action

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, ensure you have:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- NVIDIA RTX 4090/4080 (recommended) or RTX 4070 Ti (minimum)
- CUDA 12.2
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Course Structure

The course is organized into 5 modules:

1. **Module 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Nodes, URDF, controllers)
2. **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo, Unity, sensor simulation)
3. **Module 3**: Isaac Platform (VSLAM, navigation, RL, synthetic data)
4. **Module 4**: VLA (Whisper → LLM → ROS actions)
5. **Capstone**: Autonomous Humanoid Robot (voice → plan → navigate → detect → manipulate)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2 nodes for robot control
- Create and simulate robot models in Gazebo
- Implement SLAM and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac
- Build Vision-Language-Action pipelines
- Integrate all components into an autonomous humanoid robot system

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./module-1-ros2/_category_.json) to establish the foundation for all subsequent modules.
