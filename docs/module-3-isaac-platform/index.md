# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module covers the NVIDIA Isaac platform for robotics perception and navigation, including Isaac Sim for simulation and synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception, and Nav2 for bipedal humanoid path planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for humanoid robot simulation
- Generate synthetic data for training perception systems
- Implement hardware-accelerated VSLAM using Isaac ROS
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid navigation
