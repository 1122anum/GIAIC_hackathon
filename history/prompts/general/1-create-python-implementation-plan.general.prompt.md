# Create Python Implementation Plan for AI Education Project

## Prompt

```
Update the py_sp.plan file by adding project-aligned content for:
Module 1
Module 2
Module 3
Module 4

For each module, include:
- Clear objectives
- Technical topics
- Practical tasks
- Expected outcomes

Ensure content follows real project requirements and avoid vibe-based or generic coding.
```

## Response

Created a comprehensive Python Implementation Plan (py_sp.plan) for the AI's Impact on K-12 Education and Physical AI Humanoid Systems project. The plan includes four detailed modules:

### Module 1: Educational AI Toolkit
- Objectives: Develop AI tools for K-12 environments, interactive demonstrations, assessment systems
- Technical topics: NLP, computer vision, ML, API design
- Practical tasks: NLP module, CV components, ML models, APIs, GUI
- Expected outcomes: Interactive tools, assessment systems, personalized learning

### Module 2: Simulation Environment
- Objectives: Create simulation environments for AI testing, virtual classrooms
- Technical topics: Physics engines, 3D visualization, RL environments
- Practical tasks: PyBullet integration, 3D environments, RL training
- Expected outcomes: High-fidelity simulation, educational scenarios

### Module 3: Humanoid Control Systems
- Objectives: Robust control systems, educational interfaces, safety protocols
- Technical topics: ROS integration, real-time control, sensor fusion
- Practical tasks: ROS nodes, safety systems, motion planning
- Expected outcomes: Safe robot control, educational programming interface

### Module 4: Educational Analytics and Reporting
- Objectives: Data collection, learning insights, educator dashboards
- Technical topics: Data pipelines, statistical analysis, privacy-preserving analytics
- Practical tasks: Data collection, analysis tools, dashboards
- Expected outcomes: Analytics platform, privacy-compliant systems

The plan includes technical context, constitution check, project structure, deployment configuration, and dependencies relevant to the educational AI project.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed Python implementation plan that aligns with the project's focus on AI's impact on K-12 education and physical AI humanoid systems. The plan is specific to educational requirements and includes all requested components for each module.
